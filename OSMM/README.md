These are QGIS Styling files for use with OS Mastermap layers stored in PostGIS. 
The layers were created by loading OS GZ/GML files into PostGIS by using Astun Technology's Loader. 
As such these files will create styles for OSMM layers that have loaded into PostGIS using the Loader.  
You can however use these as a template for styles loaded by other means if you change the rules set in the stlyes to reference the relevant field in your PostGIS tables.
